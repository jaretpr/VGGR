VGGR (Video-Game Genre Recognition) is a Deep-Learning Image Classification project. The training, validation, and test datasets consist of gameplay images, as well as different augmentations.

## Requirements
1. Install Python **3.10** or newer.
2. Install [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/) (I used 2.2.2 + cu121)
3. Install the required packages by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in your shell of choice. Make sure you are in the project directory.
4. Unzip the test set located in *data/test/*.


## Usage
**Example 1:**
>```
>python DLQR.py --demo
>```
\
\
**Example 2:**
>```
>python
>```
or
>```
>python

\
\
**Example 3:**
>```
>python

or
>```
>python

You can predict with the included pre-trained models, and re-train if needed.

Delete the existing model to train from scratch (both options require training data).
